# 0x10. Python - Network #0

This project includes various scripts and a Python function focusing on HTTP requests using `curl` and an algorithm to find a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

## Files Description

1. **0-body_size.sh** - Bash script that sends a request to a URL and displays the size of the response body in bytes.
2. **1-body.sh** - Bash script that sends a GET request to a URL and displays the body of a 200 status code response.
3. **2-delete.sh** - Bash script that sends a DELETE request to a URL and displays the body of the response.

5. **4-header.sh** - Bash script that sends a GET request with a custom header to a URL and displays the body of the response.
6. **5-post_params.sh** - Bash script that sends a POST request with specific data to a URL and displays the body of the response.
7. **6-peak.py** and **6-peak.txt** - Python script to find a peak in a list of unsorted integers and a text file containing the time complexity of the algorithm.

## Usage

Each script can be executed on a Unix-like system using the following command:
```bash
